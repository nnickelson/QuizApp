# QuizApp

This is a desktop flashcard application written in C# that can be used for studying,creating and taking practice quizzes, as well as sharing created flashcards. This project was created in the spring of 2018 as an intro to software engineering project that my partner and I worked on in our free time. 

This project will be improved and restructured throughout the spring of 2019 to adhere to proper design patterns and eliminate code redundancies that are present in the current version of this project. We did not adhere to design patterns intially since we finished this project before having a deep understanding of design patterns and which pattern is appropriate for certian situatons.

Future improvements will include:
* Restructuring of class diagram.
* Restructuring of code to conform to appropriate design patterns.
* Eliminatining code redundancies.
