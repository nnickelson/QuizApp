File Formats for Quiz App

1. Quiz Deck
   
   The Quiz deck is a list of question class objects that, when created, is stored in the bin\debug folder as a "filename".json file.  
   It is a text-based file in JSON format that stores the current state of a QuestionDeck object and can be accessed via 
   the TakeQuiz class, CreateDeck, or EditDeck. Once the JSON file string is deserialized it will be read into a QuestionDeck object.
   There can be multiple types of this file.
   The structure is as follows -
   ( // comments are not present in the actual JSON file )
   ( "***   ***" are descriptions of what is placed inside of that set of quotation marks):
   
   {
         "Name": "*** a string value representing the name of the deck ***",
         "Questions":                     // Questions needs to be of type List<Question>
         [                                
               {
                     "QuestionText": "*** the actual question ****",
                     "QuestionType": "*** choices are 'multiplechoice' 'truefalse' 'fillinblank' ***",
                     "PossibleAnswers":   // PossibleAnswers needs to of type List<Answer>      
                     [
                           {
                                 "Answer": "*** a possible answer choice to this particular question ***"
                           },
                           {
                           // As many additional possible Answer objects as needed in the format above
                           }
                     ],
                     "CorrectAnswer": "*** an integer value representing the List index value of the correct answer in PossibleAnswers***",                     "NumberOfTimesAsked": "*** an integer value representing the number of times this questions has been asked on a quiz ***",
                     "NumberOfTimesRight": "*** an integer value representing the number of times this question has been answered correctly ***"
               },
               {
               // As many additional Question objects as needed in the format above
               }
         ],
         "QuizDates":                  // QuizDates needs to be of type List<Date>
         [
               {
                     "DateTaken": "*** a date object ***"
               },
               {
               // As many additional Date objects as needed in the format above
               }
         ],
         "QuizScores":               // QuizScores needs to be of type List<double>
         [
               {
                     "Score": "*** a double representing the quiz score for a quiz taken on date of the same index ***"               },
               {
               // Should be the same size as the QuizDates array
               }
         ]    
   }
   
   
2. Quiz Settings
   
   Quiz Settings will be stored as a text-based file in the JSON format. When created, it will be placed in the 
   bin\debug folder and can be accessed through the CreateQuiz class or TakeQuiz class. It stores the current
   state of a QuizSetting class object. Once the JSON format string is deserialized, it will be read into a
   QuizSetting object for use or modification. There can be multiple types of this file.
   The structure is as follows -
   ( // comments are not present in the actual JSON file )   ( "***   ***" are descriptions of what is placed inside of that set of quotation marks):
      
    {
         "QuizName": "*** a string value representing the name of the quiz ***",
         "IsTimed": "*** a bool value set to true if timed, false if not ***",
         "QuizMinutes": "*** is null if IsTimed is false, else is a positive integer value representing the number of minutes for a timed quiz ***",
         "NumberOfQuestions": "*** an integer value representing the number of questions for this QuizSetting ***"
         "Decks":                // Decks needs to be of type List<String>

                    "DeckName": "*** a string value representing the name of a deck minus the .json file suffix ***"
               },
               {
               // As many additional deck names as needed in the format above
               }
         ],
         "PastQuizDates":        // PastQuizDates needs to be of type List<Date>
         [

               },
               {
               // As many additional QuizDates as needed in the format above
                }
         ]
         "PastQuizScores":       // PastQuizScores needs to be of type List<double>
         [
               {
                     "QuizScore": "*** a double representing a quiz score for the QuizDate of the same index ***"
               },
               {
               // Should be the same size as the PastQuizDates array
               }
         ]
   }
   
   
3. Study deck   
   
   The Study deck is a list of flashcard class objects that, when created, is stored in the bin\debug folder titled "MyDecks" which is
   the parent directory that contains all of the users created decks. Inside the parent directory, each deck the user creates
   also has a folder which is the name of whatever the specific deck that the user created is called. Each one of those folders contains
   a text based file in JSON format that stores the string for the front of the cards and back of the cards. The folders also contain
   another folder titled "Images" that stores all of the Jpeg pictures associated with that deck.Once the JSON file string is deserialized
   it will be read into a StudyDeck object.
   
   Example of JSON format for study deck
   
   {
      "FlashCards": 
      [
        {
          "front": "This can be a phrase, title, or paragraph that is stored as a string",
           "back": "This can also be a phrase, title, or paragraph that is stored as a string",
           "image": "This is a string that represents the path to the location of the of the image. 
                    If this is not provided then this field will simply be an empty string that indicates that there is 
                    no image associated with that particular flashcard."
        }
      ]
   }
   
   
   Example of directory structure
   *Note: [ "name" ]  represents a folder,"info.json" represents a file, "pic.jpeg" represents an image.
  
  If someone wants to import a deck, they simply need to import the specified deck folder, "Astronomy"
  for example,  and then drop it into the "MyDecks" folder. Similarly, if they wanted to export a deck, they need but to simply
  copy the name of the specified deck to wherever they would like to store it. Both of these explanations makes the assumption
  that a user may want to do the process manually because maybe to them it is faster and more convienet. There will be buttons
  in the applicaton that users can use to import and export a deck if they do not want to do it manually.
