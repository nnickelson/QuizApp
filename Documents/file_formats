1. Quiz Deck
   
   The Quiz deck is a list of question class objects that is stored in the bin\debug folder as a "filename".json file.  
   It is a text-based file in JSON format that stores the current state of a QuestionDeck object and can be accessed via 
   the Quiz class, Create Deck, or Edit deck. Once the JSON string is deserialized it will be read into a QuestionDeck object. 
   The structure is as follows ( // comments are not present in the actual JSON file ):
   
   {
      "Question":                      // This array is what will populate List<Question> in QuestionDeck which will
      [                                // vary in size based on each QuestionDeck
          {
              "QuestionText": "*** the actual question ****",
              "QuestionType": "*** choices are 'multiplechoice' 'truefalse' 'fillinblank' ***",
              "PossibleAnswers":
              [
                  // This is an array that will populate the List<Answer> section which will vary in size based on each question
                  {
                  "Answer": "*** a possible answer choice to this particular question ***"
                  },
                  {
                  // As many additional possible Answer objects as needed in the format above
                  }
              ],
              "CorrectAnswer": "*** an integer value representing the List index value of the correct answer in PossibleAnswers***",
              "NumberOfTimesAsked": "*** an integer value representing the number of times this questions has been asked on a quiz ***",
              "NumberOfTimesRight": "*** an integer value representing the number of times this question has been answered correctly ***"
         },
         {
         // As many additional Question objects as needed in the format above
         }
      ],
      "QuizDates":                  // This is an array that will populate List<Date>
      [
          {
              "DateTaken": "*** a date object ***"
          },
          {
          // As many additional Date objects as needed in the format above
          }
      ],
      "QuizScores":               // This is an array that will populate List<double>
      [
          {
              "Score": "*** a double representing the quiz score for a quiz taken on date of the same index ***"
          },
          {
          // Should have the same number of elements as QuizDates
          }
      ]
