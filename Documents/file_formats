1. Quiz Deck
   
   The Quiz deck is a list of question class objects that, when created, is stored in the bin\debug folder as a "filename".json file.  
   It is a text-based file in JSON format that stores the current state of a QuestionDeck object and can be accessed via 
   the TakeQuiz class, CreateDeck, or EditDeck. Once the JSON file string is deserialized it will be read into a QuestionDeck object.
   There can be multiple types of this file.
   The structure is as follows -
   ( // comments are not present in the actual JSON file )
   ( "***   ***" are descriptions of what is placed inside of that set of quotation marks):
